DEAP optimisation
=================

Using the eFEL, pyNeuron and the DEAP optimisation library one can very easily 
set up a genetic algorithm to fit parameters of a neuron model.

In this example we will assume you have installed 
`eFEL <https://github.com/BlueBrain/eFEL>`_, 
`pyNeuron <http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/new_doc/index.html>`_ 
and `DEAP <https://github.com/DEAP/deap>`_

The code of the example below can be downloaded from 
`here <https://github.com/BlueBrain/eFEL/tree/master/examples/deap>`_
